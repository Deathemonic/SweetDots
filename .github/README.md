## :question: <samp>ABOUT</samp>

<img alt="Rice Preview" align="right" width="400px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots/xorg/.github/assets/unixporn.png"/>

Welcome, Thanks for droping by! This is my dotfiles that I made, it's a dotfiles design to be understandable and hackable by anyone and themed with [**sweetpastel**](https://github.com/sweetpastel).

Instead of making multiple ``Window Manager Configs`` with different style I opt in on just one style but it should be compatible to other ``Window Manage`` so if you switch to another ``Window Manager`` it should be the same style, plus it's less work. All the configs are stored in a folder so it won't conflict at your pre existing configs **(Except of the window managers they will conflict unless you backup your old files)**

## :books: <samp>WIKI</samp> <kbd>RECOMMENDED</kbd>
If you have problems or need some information about the dotfiles check [wiki page](https://github.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots/wiki), it provides extra information, some documentation, and a troubleshoot page

## :package: <samp>INSTALL</samp>

<details open>
	<summary><b><samp>AUTO INSTALL</samp></b></summary>
<br>

<kbd>RECOMMENDED</kbd>

Copy and paste this command at your **Terminal**
	
```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots/xorg/install)"
```

> **Note:** <br>
> You need ``curl``, ``bash`` and ``git`` installed in your system.
> Also if you are not using ``archlinux`` the installer won't install the dependencies automatically you have to manually install them.
> Check out this [link](https://github.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots/wiki/Documentation#dependencies) for the list of dependencies

<details>
	<summary><b><samp>MANUAL INSTALL</samp></b></summary>
<br>

> **Note:** <br>
> First up install the dependencies need if not the dotfiles doesn't work.
> Check out this [link](https://github.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots/wiki/Documentation#dependencies) for the list of dependencies

1. Download or Clone the repo and go to that directory
	
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Deathemonic/SweetDots -b xorg && cd SweetDots
```

2. Make a backup folder for the conflicting folders
	
```sh
mkdir ~/.backups
```
	
3. Move the conflicting folders to the backup folder depending if you have them

```sh
mv ~/.config/berry ~/.backups/
mv ~/.config/bspwm ~/.backups/
mv ~/.config/i3 ~/.backups/
mv ~/.config/leftwm ~/.backups/
```

4. Copy the ``sweetconfigs-xorg`` to your ``~/.config``
	
```sh
cp -rf sweetconfigs-xorg ~/.config/
```
	
5. Copy the window manager you config in your ``~/.config``

```sh
cp -rf window-managers/* ~/.config/
```
	
- If you have bspwm then copy ``cp -rf window-managers/bspwm`` to ``~/.config`` then you if you have bspwm and berry then copy both folders and etc.

```sh
cp -rf window-managers/berry ~/.config/
cp -rf window-managers/bspwm ~/.config/
cp -rf window-managers/i3 ~/.config/
cp -rf window-managers/leftwm ~/.config/
```

- If you have berry you may have to copy the ``berry.desktop`` in the xsessions folder in order for the display manager to see it

```sh
sudo cp misc/xsessions/berry.desktop /usr/share/xsessions
```

6. Change the scripts into exutables

```sh
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/bin/bar/*
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/bin/menu/*
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/bin/system/*
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/bin/utilities/*
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/bin/widgets/*
chmod +x ~/.config/sweetconfigs-xorg/eww/scripts/*
```

- If you only installed bspwm then make ``bspwmrc`` into a excutable

```sh
chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
```

- If you only installed berry then make ``autostart`` into a excutable

```sh
chmod +x ~/.config/berry/autostart
```

	
Finally just reboot or logout of your session and log back in

## :art: <samp>COLORSCHEME</samp>

It's the color scheme I made and improved by [**``siduck``**](https://github.com/siduck), I was originally just gonna use [``paradise``](https://github.com/paradise-theme/paradise) or [``gruvbox``](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) because it didn't fit well so [**sweetpastel**](https://github.com/sweetpastel) was born.

If you want to see the ports check it out at it's official [Github Page](https://github.com/SweetPastel)

## :memo: <samp>TODO</samp>

**Focusing**
- [ ] ~~Wayland Version~~ Merging everything to one branch (Wayland and Xorg)
- [ ] Port all the scripts to python

**Planning**
- [ ] Better Padding for Widgets
- [ ] Improve the widget layout
- [ ] Use a better text scroller (Might create my own in rust)
- [ ] Use modules more on widgets
- [ ] Add a cconfiguration file to manage the configs easily
- [ ] Add screenshots on README.md
- [ ] Nix Support (Priority Low)

**Done**
- [x] Add top-panel to all window managers

**Removed**
- ~~Use pijulius's fork of picom~~
- ~~Use [xborders](https://github.com/deter0/xborder) for fixing the border bugs~~
- ~~Add more options for window manager forks~~ - Will heavily focus on just the configs
